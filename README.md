# Hey, I'm dxzhtt! 👋

🌟 Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm dxzhtt, a developer from **Indonesia** diving headfirst into the exciting world of **Web3**. From NFTs to DeFi, I’m all about exploring tech that shapes the future. 🚀

## About Me
- 📍 **From**: Indonesia, a land of vibrant culture and endless inspiration!
- 💻 **Focus**: Building Web3 projects, especially in ecosystems like ZenChain.
- 🐦 **Twitter**: Follow me at [@rwahyu1410](https://x.com/rwahyu1410) to chat Web3 or share crypto memes!
- 🌈 **Vibes**: Love coding to music, creating TikTok videos, and hanging out in Discord communities.

## What I’m Working On
I’m actively contributing to the **ZenChain** community (#BuildWithZEN) with projects like:
- **[ZenChain NFT Gallery](https://github.com/rwahyu1410/zenchain-nft-gallery)**: A "Coming Soon" page for NFT collections with slick animations.
- **ZEN Staking Calculator** (coming soon!): A simple tool to calculate staking rewards on ZenChain.
- More ideas brewing in my Google Keep notes! 😄

## Why Web3?
I believe Web3 is the key to a more open and fair world. From Jakarta to global communities, I want to make an impact through code and collaboration. If you’re into Web3, let’s connect!

## Let’s Collaborate!
- 📩 DM me on Twitter [@rwahyu1410](https://x.com/rwahyu1410) or ZenChain Discord.
- Check out my projects and drop a star if you like them! 🌟
- Got a Web3 idea? Want to build something together? I’m all in for coding collabs!

## Fun Facts
